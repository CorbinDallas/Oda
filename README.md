#Welcome#
Oda is a lightweight JSON plugin framework that replaces the GET/POST key/value pair dichotomy 
with a pure JSON solution, adds JSON method mapping as well as a easy to use plugin 
architecture.  Oda will eventually have many plugins that can be used to connect to connect
to a database, authenticate, commerce and a full JavaScript UI API.
