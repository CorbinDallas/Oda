#Welcome#
Oda is a lightweight JSON plugin framework that replaces the GET/POST key/value pair dichotomy 
with a pure JSON solution, adds JSON method mapping as well as a easy to use plugin 
architecture.  Oda will eventually have many plugins that can be used to connect
to a database, authenticate, commerce and much more.

##Goals##
The goals of Oda is to provide an easy way to make AJAX/JSON web sites 
without having to employ heavy weight frameworks to get JSON requests and responses flowing through your application. 

##What can it do right now?##
Oda right now supports a JSON method mapping system and plugins.  There are a few plugins available too:

1. Oda.Sql.  Allows connections to a Microsoft SQL Server 2003 or newer.  Comes with many JSON utilities for SQL.
2. Oda.Authentication.  Allows for secure authentication, account and contact management.
