#Welcome#
Oda is a very lightweight JSON plugin framework that replaces the GET/POST key/value pair dichotomy with a pure JSON solution, adds method and class mapping as well as a very easy to use plugin architecture that is the core of Oda.  

##Mission, Goals, etc..##
The goals of Oda is to provide an easy way to make AJAX/JSON web sites without having to employ heavy weight frameworks to get JSON requests and responses flowing through your application. 

##What can it do right now?##
Oda right now supports a sophisticated JSON request/response system, plugins and a hierarchical embedded file system with the ability to override the embedded files with files in the physical file system.  Oda will eventually include a robust JavaScript UI API.  

##Examples? Yeah, we got examples.##
There are a few (two) sample plugins (SQL, Authentication).  More plugins will come later as we test how Oda needs to fit the needs of plugin developers.

##Well hey, sign me up!##
A few help pages are already available for people interested in giving it a spin:

I Hope you enjoy Oda as much as I enjoyed creating it.
